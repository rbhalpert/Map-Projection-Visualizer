# Projection Distortion Lab

Production-oriented v1 scaffold for an educational app comparing true great-circle distance to projected map segment length.

## Tech stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Zustand
- d3-geo + d3-geo-projection-ready registry
- CesiumJS dependency installed for upcoming globe panel
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitest + React Testing Library
- ESLint + Prettier

## Current milestone coverage
- ✅ Project initialized with tooling and strict TypeScript setup
- ✅ Core geo utilities with tests
- ✅ Projection registry with required v1 projections
- ✅ One working Web Mercator panel
- ✅ Endpoint input + live true distance + live projected pixel length

## Scripts
```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run test
npm run lint
```
